Title: A Two-stage Real-time Discrimination Method for Spiral Weld Defects under Dynamic Fuzzy Imaging

The dynamic blurred videos (supplementary material) have been placed in the code link under the name Supplementary_material_Dynamic_videos.zip

To provide readers with a clearer understanding of the spiral steel pipe production and defect detection process, we have included a detailed explanatory video, 
which can be found at:  https://youtu.be/f1y_JqG9-D8

This is the open source URL for the paper "A Two-stage Real-time Discrimination Method for Spiral Weld Defects under Dynamic Fuzzy Imaging" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. 
We will publish our code and datasets soon.

# Demo 
To better understand our method, we have made the demo public. Currently, we have developed unsupervised detection methods for static images and two-stage dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection methods. In addition, we further studied the multi-task defect detection method and instantiated our method in an industrial field. Video can be found in [YouTube] (https://youtu.be/vKmVoBKwP0Q) to see. Our multi-task detection method can be found at https://github.com/MT-weld/MTDF, a link that contains more video of the actual scene.
