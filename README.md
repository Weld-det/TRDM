Title: A Two-stage Real-time Discrimination Method for Spiral Weld Defects under Dynamic Fuzzy Imaging

The dynamic blurred videos (supplementary material) have been placed in the code link under the name Supplementary_material_Dynamic_videos.zip

To provide readers with a clearer understanding of the spiral steel pipe production and defect detection process, we have included a detailed explanatory video, 
which can be found at:  https://youtu.be/f1y_JqG9-D8

This is the open source URL for the paper "A Two-stage Real-time Discrimination Method for Spiral Weld Defects under Dynamic Fuzzy Imaging" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. 
We will publish our code and datasets soon.
